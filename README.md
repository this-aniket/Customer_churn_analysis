# Customer_churn_analysis

A model to identify predictors that differentiate risky customers from others.
The data set has 425 cases of past and current customers who have borrowed from a bank for various
reasons. The data set contains customer-related information such as financial standing, reason for the loan,
employment, demographic information, and the outcome or dependent variable for credit standing, classifying
each case as good or bad, based on the institution’s past experience.
Built a decision tree model to learn the characteristics of the problem, Test its performance using various tuning
parameters. Used RapidMiner fro the decision tree model.

a. Predictors: “RapidMiner – Decision Trees” to generate a decision tree. Tuned “minimal leaf size” to obtain the
optimal tree size.
b. Model Performance: Generated a confusion matrix to explain the model’s performance.
c. A summary of your findings. What was learnt from the data? What was the takeaway for
the executive? What were the insights?
